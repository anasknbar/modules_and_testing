### lab-02

## summary:

- in this lab we practice what we learned in the lec-02 about python modules and unit testing using pytest library
- the lab require us to make two functions to calculate the factorial number of n
- the first function has to be scripted using the for whearas the second has to use the recurion 
- both function are placed into file called factorial_module.py which in turn inside a folder factorial_module
- both factorial_module and test directoies have _init _.py 
- we use pytest library to test the two functions corner cases
- also we use pytest.raises to test catching error which is one of the pytest library method.
